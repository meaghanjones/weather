## Description

Weather
Use the lesson on <a href="https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/javascript/modern-js-apps/alarm-clock-weather-app">Using an API</a>
as a reference to create your own weather app with the Open <a href="http://openweathermap.org/">Weather Map API</a>. Be sure to build it from scratch instead of using ping-pong as a starting point as the lesson does. Here are your goals:

* Create a button which displays the humidity of a city, as we do in the lesson. Remember to include error checking.
* Create a button to display the current temperature of the city. Hint: This data will be given to you in degrees Kelvin. Create a temperature.js module to translate degrees Kelvin into Celsius and also into Fahrenheit. Include a separate temperature-interface.js file to handle triggering the API call and displaying the temperature.
* First display both Kelvin and Celsius, then add functionality to allow the user to choose to display either Celsius or Fahrenheit.
* Choose another part of the weather API to explore, and feel free to restructure your app's frontend. You could show more of the current weather conditions besides humidity and temperature. You could use the data in different ways - for example, what if I want to know how much warmer it is right now in Portland than in Moscow? Could you make an app for people to compare the weather in multiple cities? Or you could display data about the 5 day forecast for a given city. Or you could work with their interactive weather maps and historical data.
